                                retail return policies.  A client of mine, a national sporting goods 
                                chain, is facing a surge in customers attempting to return used or 
                                significantly damaged merchandise without receipts.  While our policy 
                                clearly outlines a return window and receipt requirement, these customers
                                 are becoming increasingly belligerent when denied.</p>

                                Hi everyone! I need some help with a copyright conundrum. I'm a freelance 
                                graphic designer, and a client recently commissioned me to create a logo for 
                                their new bakery. We had a signed contract outlining the project scope and 
                                payment, but nowhere did it explicitly mention copyright ownership. Now, 
                                the client wants to use the logo on merchandise, something we never discussed.  
                                Do I still own the copyright?
                            </p>

                                Hi everyone! I'm freaking out a bit and really need some advice. 
                                My rent is a few days late due to a car repair that completely blew my budget.
                                My landlord showed up at my door earlier today and threatened to lock me out if I didn't pay the rent immediately! 
                                Is that even legal?  I mean, I understand I owe the rent, and I'll definitely be paying it as soon as possible.
                                </p>
