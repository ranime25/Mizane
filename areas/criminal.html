    <div class="text-area">
        <p style="color:rgb(228, 228, 227);">
        criminal law, the body of law that defines criminal offenses, regulates the apprehension, charging, and trial of suspected persons, and fixes penalties and modes of treatment applicable to convicted offenders.</p>
        <h2>Criminal Law Procedure</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(228, 228, 227);">
        Criminal law procedure refers to the process of charging, prosecuting, and assigning punishment for criminal offenses. The actual procedures for dealing with criminal matters vary by jurisdiction, and written procedures exist for local, state, and federal jurisdictions, all of which generally begin with formal criminal charges, and end with the acquittal or conviction, and sentencing if appropriate, of a defendant.
        criminal law procedure places the burden of proof squarely on the prosecution, requiring the prosecution to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty. This relieves the defendant of having to prove his innocence, and any doubt as to the defendant’s guilt on any charge is resolved in his favor. This concept is known as “the presumption of innocence.”</p>


        <h2> Criminal Law in Action</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(228, 228, 227);">
        The world is filled with people committing acts considered criminal offenses. From writing checks on a closed bank account, to murder and mayhem, the variety of ways people seek to thwart the law and cause harm to others is astounding. Throughout the years, many criminal law cases have been so astonishing as to make headlines.</p>

        <h2>Criminal Law Attorney</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(228, 228, 227);">
        When someone has been charged with a crime, he has a Constitutional right to representation by an attorney. A criminal law attorney is one who specializes in criminal defense, and has experience in dealing with the prosecutor’s office, as well as in criminal trials. A criminal law attorney may handle a wide spectrum of criminal case types, such as theft, fraud, and embezzlement, as well as DUI, drug crimes, violent crimes, and sex crimes. Some criminal defense attorney’s specialize in one area of criminal law, such as corporate fraud, or violent crimes.</p>

        <h2>Types of Criminal Law</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(228, 228, 227);">What is a criminal act ? There are two main types of criminal law: felonies and misdemeanors. A felony is a serious crime that usually carries a jail sentence of at least one year. Examples of felonies include murder, grand larceny, and rape. Misdemeanors are less serious offenses, and usually include jail sentences of less than one year. Sometimes, committing a misdemeanor can result in no jail time at all. One example of a misdemeanor is petty theft.</p>
