        <h1>what to know befor any property purchase ?:</h1>
        <p>
            What are the things we need to know before buying any property?
            How to obtain a property is considered more important than obtaining the property itself, as real estate investment is one of the most important and largest types of investments ever.
            For this reason, what are the things we need to know and consider before buying any property?</p>
            <h4>1- Building permit:</h4>
            <p>It is a permit issued by the municipality allowing the builder to construct. The license is based on Article 21 of Law 3194 relating to building permits. Municipalities regulate building permits after procedures required of the contractor.</p>
            <h4>2- Total area of the apartment and net area:</h4>
           <p>
            One of the most important questions that concerns the buyer, especially when buying before construction, is what is the net and total area of the apartment. Real estate development companies usually present their apartments with total areas, and if the buyer does not inquire about the net area of the apartment before purchasing, they may be surprised to find a smaller apartment than expected. The difference between them is that the total area is the area of the apartment plus the area of the facilities related to the apartment such as parking spaces, etc., while the net area is the actual area of the apartment.
           </p> 
           <h4>3- Soil study for construction (geotechnical):</h4>
           <p>It is a report of a geotechnical study conducted on the land to ensure the safety of the building and its residents, soil resistance to earthquakes and slides. These studies are especially emphasized in newly opened land for construction.</p>
           <h4>4- Quality of materials used in construction:</h4>
           <p>It is important to know the quality and type of materials used in construction.</p>
          <h4>5- Project location and proximity to (public transportation, health and educational centers, and services):
         </h4>
         <p>
            For those interested in housing or investment, it is necessary to consider the location of the project and its proximity to public transportation, health, educational, and service centers.
         </p> 
         <h4>6- Floor ownership document:</h4>
         <p>Very important (to be clarified in a subsequent article).</p>
         <h4>7- Facilities available in the project:</h4>
         <p>Such as swimming pools, tennis courts, football fields, basketball courts, parks, pedestrian paths, fitness centers</p>
         <h4>8- Electric generator when needed and water pumps:
        </h4>
         <p>To avoid residents being affected by electricity and water supply problems.</p>

         <h4>9- Developing company:</h4>
         <p>Inquire about the experience and history of the developing company, its completed projects, and the services it offers after purchase.</p>

         <h4>10- Heating system type:</h4>
         <p>Is it a central heating system or a natural gas heating system (combination)? Also, knowing the quality of thermal insulation and the monthly heating mechanism.</p>

         <h4>11- Building age:</h4>
         <p>It is important to know the age of the building, especially for buildings constructed before earthquakes. For buildings over 50 years old, it is necessary to ensure their ability to withstand earthquakes.</p>

         <h4>12- Building returns:</h4>
         <p>It is a monthly amount collected from apartment owners by the management of the residential area for various services provided by the management (such as pools, fitness centers, elevators, security, and in some residential projects, monthly returns can reach up to $800 per month.</p>
