      <h1>The punishment of spouses in verbal and psychological violence</h1>

          <p>
            The Algerian law recognizes verbal and psychological violence between spouses, as explicitly stated in Article 266 bis 1 of the Penal Code. However, certain conditions must be met:</p>

            <h4>The essential condition:</h4> 
            <p>in the crime of insults and defamation between spouses is the existence of a presumed condition for the victim. This means that the victim must be a legitimate or legal wife, or a former wife, and the actions must be related to the former marriage. It does not matter whether the husband resides with the victim or not in the same dwelling. If the woman is a lover, fianc√©e, or girlfriend during the engagement period, she is not protected by this provision.</p>

            
          <h4>Regarding the material condition</h4><p> it involves committing any form of repeated verbal or psychological abuse or violence by one spouse against the other, affecting the victim's dignity or physical or mental well-being.</p>
          <h4>Verbal violence</h4>
          <p>manifests in continuous insults, ignoring, or rejecting the wife, such as saying to her "I wish I hadn't married you, you are worthless, stupid, you have no value," etc</p>
          <h4>Psychological violence:</h4>
          <p>involves the husband insulting and describing the wife with qualities that diminish her value, despising her, defaming her, or vilifying her, whether between spouses, in front of children, or in public. It includes threats of divorce or marrying another woman repeatedly, affecting her mental well-being, such as causing nervous or mental illnesses, for example.</p>
          <h4>Regarding the moral condition</h4>
          <p> the legislator does not require the presence of criminal intent in this crime. Whether the husband commits this act intentionally or unintentionally out of anger, for example, he is liable for this crime because this type of violence affects the victim directly upon its occurrence, whether the husband intended it or not. This can be inferred from the absence of the word "intentionally." If it were present, it would mean that criminal intent (knowledge and will) must be present, and the legislator has stipulated repetition as evidence of intent. If the husband assaults his wife once, this crime does not apply to him.</p>

         <h4>Regarding evidence</h4>
         <p>the legislator considers marital violence provable by all means, expecting that verbal or psychological violence can occur indirectly, such as through the use of phones, text messages (SMS), emails, or social media networks. The crime occurs whether the perpetrator resides with the victim or not.</p>

         <h4>Regarding the penalty</h4>
         <p>the perpetrator is punished by imprisonment for one to three years. The offending husband does not benefit from mitigating circumstances if the victim is pregnant, disabled, or if the crime is committed in the presence of minor children or under threat of weaponss</p>
