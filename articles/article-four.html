        <h1>blackmails according to the algerian laws:</h1>
        <p>The threat of images and extortion of persons is one of the most heinous acts in the various laws, a person who has another person's personal image and who is usually a girl or a woman and who blackmails her by posting and exposing her on Internet sites and social media if she does not give him what he wants, and of course she is an immoral demand. The threat of images towards a man may be to force him to agree to something, and the offender threatens him to publish pictures of his family members if he does not agree to his demands and usually does so with those in positions and influence. He continued to read with us the article on the punishment of threats to images in Algerian law.
          The known blackmail threat was to threaten to kill, kidnap, harm or harm a person in the event that he or she failed to carry out the criminal vil actes s, despicable claims, which were financial or sexual, and possibly the termination of interests. With the widespread Internet and the spread of images that are shared with all, patients of souls are threatening to defamate them and disseminate their images, especially to girls.
          Despite the awful nature of this act, it is now easier than ever. With a few steps, anyone can report electronic extortion, and within 24 hours the offender is stopped from doing what he is doing and cannot publish any photographs or information.
  
          </p>
          <h4>Threat Definition:</h4>
          <p>
            It is every word or sign or writing that informs the other person and scares him that he will be subjected to an event, usually murder, theft, kidnapping, or defamation, and in many cases, the victim submits to the demands of the perpetrator out of fear of the threat, and with the wider use of the Internet and the exchange of personal images among individuals, those with sick souls use those images to threaten their owners with defamation, so the law stood in front of them by imposing harsh penalties similar to the penalty for real threa</p>
          <h4>The prescribed penalty for the crime of extortion with photos:</h4>
          <h6>
            Article 303 repeated A
        </h6>
          <p>
              
              Shall be punished by imprisonment from six (6) months to three (3) years and a fine of 50,000 DZD to 300,000 DZD, anyone who deliberately violates the privacy of individuals, by any means, as follows:
              -1 By capturing, recording, or transmitting private or secret conversations or discussions without the consent or approval of the owner.
              -2 By capturing, recording, or transmitting a picture of a person in a private place without the consent or approval of the owner.
              Attempted commission of the offense provided for in this Article shall be punishable by the same penalties prescribed for the completed crime.
              The victim may request the cessation of criminal </p>
              <p></p>
              
             <h6>Article 303 repeated 1 A:</h6> 
              <p>Shall be punished by the penalties provided for in the preceding Article, anyone who retains, places, or allows to be placed within reach of the public or others, or uses by any means, recordings, images, or documents obtained by one of the acts specified in Article 303 repeated of this law.
              When the offense specified in the preceding paragraph is committed through the press, the special provisions provided for in the relevant laws shall apply to determine the responsible persons.
              Attempted commission of the offense provided for in this Article shall be punishable by the same penalties prescribed for the completed crime.
              The victim may request the cessation of criminal proceedings.
             </p>
            
             <h6>Article 9 repeated 1 A:</h6> <p>
              Deprivation of the exercise of national, civil, and family rights consists of:
              Isolation or exclusion from all public positions and offices related to the crime,
              Deprivation of the right to vote or stand for election and of carrying any decoration,
              Ineligibility to act as an assistant juror, expert, or witness to any contract or witness before the judiciary except for evidence,
              Deprivation of the right to bear arms, to teach, or to administer a school or serve in an educational institution as a professor, teacher, or supervisor,
              Ineligibility to act as a guardian or trustee,
              Forfeiture of all or some of the guardianship rights.
              In the case of a criminal conviction, the judge must order the deprivation of one or more of the rights mentioned above for a maximum period of ten (10) years, starting from the day of the expiration of the original sentence or the release of the convicted person.
             </p>  
            <h6>Article 284 A:</h6>
            <p>
            A nyone who threatens to commit crimes of murder, imprisonment, or any other assault on individuals punishable by death or life imprisonment, whether by a written document on a website or otherwise, or by images, symbols, or logos, shall be punished by imprisonment from two to ten years and a fine of 500 to 5,000 DZD, if the threat is accompanied by an order to deposit a sum of money in a specific location or to fulfill any other condition.
             </p>
           <h4>Elements of the crime of threat:</h4>
          
           <p>
              Material element: (Involves threatening the victim with an action or condition that must be performed).
              Means of threat: (Whether by written message, verbal communication via phone, or in person).
              Moral element: Intentional motive behind the threat, aiming to cause harm.
              Conditions for blackmail threat:
  
              The purpose is to compel the victim to buy the silence of the blackmailer by not disclosing or attributing shameful matters that could tarnish their reputation or affect their standing.
              The blackmailer intends to involve the victim in a crime or ethical issue or to expose them to public opinion with something detrimental to them.
              The threat may be written or verbal, and there should be no distinction between the two methods. The judiciary has ruled that threats in writing can be carried out through the press.
              The threat must aim to gain unlawful profit or harm someone's reputation, regardless of whether the thing extorted belongs to the victim or others, or whether the extortion benefits a third party.
              There is no crime in threatening a debtor with legal recourse to fulfill their obligation.
           </p>
  
          <p>
            Today, the use of mobile phones has become essential, with most people checking their phones at the beginning of the day, during work, and in leisure time, given its connection to many aspects of our daily lives.
            With the spread of this technology, the judiciary faces numerous cases daily regarding reports of threats with images.
            Algerian legislators perceive the importance and significance of individuals' personal privacy, safeguarding it from any violation that might compromise the individual's status. Hence, the legislature intervened to provide legal protection for this moral status, considering any assault on it as a crime, impacting the victim profoundly. In Algerian society, which has always cherished its principles and noble values, such electronic crimes pose a significant threat, capable of destroying lives or stripping families of their dignity and even their belonging to society. Such crimes often leave a stigma that some may never recover from.
            Some see defamation as a means of slander or bargaining, exploiting such information for blackmail purposes, driven by animosity and the intent to harm reputations and personal grievances. Many people are shocked by the dissemination of such images and personal data, which they never consented to be shared with the public.
            These facts have urged the enactment of stringent laws against those who commit such acts with the aim of curbing them.
