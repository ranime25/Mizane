        <h1>
            the crime of verbal threat according to Algerian laws:
        </h1>
        <h4>Definition of direct verbal threat:</h4>
        <p>
            We will first define the term "threat" and then proceed to define "verbal threat". Regarding the definition of threat in the law:
         It is defined as any utterance, whether personal, through a voice message, or a text message via social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Also, gestures and signs commonly used during threatening someone are considered within the actions punishable by the law. Additionally, the use of weapons and brandishing them is also considered an act punishable by the law, even if it does not result in the death of the person. Threat is also defined as the act of intimidating someone to compel them to do something they do not desire and to engage in some forms of psychological harm, and the threat may involve actions such as defamation or tarnishing one's reputation. Authorities make considerable efforts to curb the spread of the phenomenon of threats in society to ensure the safety of all members of society under one umbrella of security. Islam prohibits any actions that may cause moral harm to others.

        </p>
        <h4>As for the legal definition of verbal threat:</h4>
        <p>It is defined as a statement issued from one party to another, through which the person is compelled to perform an unwanted act and subjected to some forms of psychological harm. The threat may involve the use of defamation or tarnishing one's reputation. It is expressed through words and is considered less serious than written threats. It usually occurs in a fit of rage or during a dispute, and therefore, it is not recognized as a crime unless it poses a danger to the threatened person, which happens when the threat is issued after the person has calmed down away from the heat of the moment.</p>

        <h4>Material and moral elements of the crime of verbal threat:</h4>
        <h5>First: The material element:</h5>
         <p>The crime of threat is an intentional crime that is fulfilled by either verbal or gestural actions.</p>
         <h5>Second: The moral element:</h5>
         <p>As for the moral element, it consists of a general criminal intent and a specific intent:</p>
          <p>The general intent is manifested in the perpetrator's intention to cause the effects of the threat, which evoke fear in the psyche of the victim.
            The specific intent mainly lies in the perpetrator's knowledge that such criminal behavior achieves the criminal result.</p>
            <h4>Explanation:</h4>
             <p>The Algerian legislator expanded the scope of criminalizing threats regarding written threats, but narrowed it down regarding verbal threats by associating it with a condition or requirement. An example of this is when someone demands from another to accompany them for a certain purpose, threatening them with imprisonment if they refuse. This type of threat is issued verbally and is less severe than a written threat. Typically, it occurs in a fit of anger and is not intended, and therefore, the legislator did not consider it a crime unless it poses a danger to the threatened person. The verbal threat issued directly from the threatener to the threatened party without the mediation of a third party is not punishable by law because it is usually the result of a sudden impulse or anger. Such threats are not typically taken seriously, as they are understood by everyone, including the threatened person, to be non-serious and unintentional, and have remained unpunished since 1910 until now.</p>

           <h4>Verbal threat accompanied by a demand:</h4>
           <p>This form of the crime of threat is stipulated in Article 286 of the Algerian Penal Code, which states: "If the threat is accompanied by an oral order or condition, the perpetrator shall be punished with imprisonment from six months to two years and a fine ranging from 500 to 1500 Algerian dinars." This type of threat is issued verbally and is less serious than a written threat because it usually occurs as a result of impulsiveness or anger, and therefore, its impact on the threatened person is not as strong as that of a written threat. This form of the crime is committed when the perpetrator threatens the victim verbally, whether through the phone or through direct communication, and the threat can be public or private.




           </p>
           <p>with a demand that the latter must fulfill, regardless of whether this demand is lawful or unlawful, and it does not matter whether this demand serves the perpetrator's personal interest or the interest of another person appointed by the perpetrator.

            If the perpetrator's threat to the victim is the result of their free will, with the knowledge that the action they are committing is capable of instilling fear in the heart of the victim to compel them to fulfill the perpetrator's demand, then this leads to the perpetrator deserving the punishment prescribed for this act. The punishment consists of imprisonment for a period not less than six months and not exceeding two years, and a fine ranging from 500 to 1500 Algerian dinars. Additionally, the court may impose a ban on residency for a minimum of one year up to a maximum of five years.</p>
            <h6>Article 284 (amended):</h6>
            <p>Anyone who threatens to commit crimes of murder, imprisonment, or any other assault on individuals punishable by death or life imprisonment, whether through a prohibited sign or not, or through images, symbols, or slogans, shall be punished by imprisonment for a period of two to ten years and a fine of 500 to 5000 Algerian dinars. If the threat is accompanied by an order to deposit a sum of money in a specific place or to fulfill any other condition, the perpetrator may also be deprived of one or more of the rights listed in Article 14, and may be banned from residency for at least one year up to a maximum of five years.</p>

            <h6>Article 285:</h6>
            <p>If the threat is not accompanied by any order or condition, the perpetrator shall be punished by imprisonment for one to three years and a fine of 500 to 2500 Algerian dinars. The court may also impose a ban on residency for at least one year up to a maximum of five years.</p>
            <h6>Article 286:</h6>
            <p>If the threat is accompanied by an oral order or condition, the perpetrator shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to two years and a fine of 500 to 1500 Algerian dinars. Additionally, the court may impose a ban on residency for at least one year up to a maximum of five years.</p>
            <h6>Article 287 (amended):</h6>
            <p>Anyone who threatens assault or violence not stipulated in Article 284 through any of the methods specified in Articles 284 to 286 shall be punished by imprisonment for three months to one year and a fine of 500 to 1000 Algerian dinars if the threat is accompanied by an order or condition.</p>
