      <h1>Insurance at work in the public sector and the private sector:</h1>
      <h4>The difference between working in the public sector and working in the private sector</h4>
      <p>First of all, the correct term is public service, not public job. This is a wrong term in formal Arabic language. The term "وظيفة" refers to the bottom of the leg (heel). Therefore, the precise legal Arabic term is public service. This word means the general meaning of serving the country, and legally it refers to any job in which the state is involved, whether in its establishment, management, or financing.</p>
      <h5>Benefits of working in the public sector:</h5>

      <p>In fact, the best thing about it is that your rights are fully guaranteed, whether it's for leave, working hours, or automatically covered insurance.</p>
      <h5> negatives of working in the public sector:</h5>
      <p>The most negative aspect is the low salary, as it is significantly lower compared to the private sector.</p>
      <h5>How does the hiring process work?:</h5>
      <p>The main idea is that employment is usually based on certificate-based competitions. A bachelor's degree is often highly sought after. As for a master's degree, it can help you if you want to advance in your job. This means that over time, your salary increases based on your additional certificates. Sometimes, however, they are not accepted because they are not required in some job sectors in the first place.</p>
      <p>The exception to the principle of competition in the public service job usually occurs in a single-position job, and it is more practical and technical than theoretical. This means, for example, as a technical worker or a guard, you are employed here based on the CV model or "Lanam" institution.</p>
      <p>Recruitment in economic sectors like postal services, national companies, and others, usually depends on the vacancies available. Some sectors require a competition, while others just need you to send your CV and wait for a response from the company. Your CV will then be placed in the central administration of that sector.</p>
      <h4>We now move on to the private sector:</h4>
      <p>In general, the word means the opposite of the public sector, meaning a sector managed, funded, or established by capitalists like private companies or private factories.</p>
      <h5>How to apply for a job:</h5>
      <p>The principle is that employment is through sending your CV and waiting for a response, or registering through the "Lanam" organization and waiting for a response according to your certificates and specialization.</p>
      <p>The exception is that there are cases where they organize a light competition in a specific field, and the winner gets a job through an oral exam to work for a large private company, for example, depending on the required specialization, of course.
        3- Private sector advantages: In fact, they are somewhat limited compared to the public sector, but for sure, there are some sectors where it's better than others, while some undervalue the worker and don't give them their rights, and others appreciate them more to increase productivity.</p>
     <h5>The drawbacks of the sector: </h5>
     <p>The biggest negative thing is insurance, meaning working without any insurance or declaration as an employee in the "Kanass" establishment. Even though the law is very strict if the employer did not declare the domestic workers, it could lead to fines and even imprisonment for the employer and the closure of their business altogether.</p>
     <p>The second negative point is the right to vacation, which usually happens once a year, but in the private sector most employers digest this right.</p>
     <p>But especially compensating for an illness or work accident in case you are not declared in the private company you work for may cause a big problem you won't know what it is until you try to understand the insurance law to know your rights.</p>
     <h4>What is insurance?:</h4>
     <p>First, we need to differentiate between the term "employee," which is a legal term referring to someone who works in the private sector only or in sectors where the public and private sectors are combined, such as shareholders or economic sectors industrial and commercial private to the state.
        "Employee" in the general sense refers to someone who works in the public sector for the state.</p>
        <p>- So if you receive your salary every month, this means that you are officially registered in the "Laqnas" institution.
            - Regarding insurance: In any sector in Algeria, the law requires the insurance of workers and employees, even if they are temporary or for a short period. This means that if your employer does not declare you before 7 working days, they could be legally pursued and face hefty fines that could affect their reputation.</p>
          <h4>What do we mean, "permit you"?:</h4>
          <p>After a legally prescribed period of months, days or years, depending on each case, you have the right: 

          </p>
          <p>
            1. Sick leave compensation 
Compensation for maternity leave for women if they have three months ; compensation from the Laknas Foundation
3. Compensation for death (capital décès capital, which is 12 times the salary of the worker, which also requires an in-depth explanation, but generally the widow of the water is entitled to it, but several important steps must be taken. 
4. Compensation for getting out of work due to a disability 
5. Compensation for a work accident or occupational disease caused to you by the practice of your work or occupation
6. Compensation for your dismissal from a company for economic reasons resulting from the force majeure of the company, which led to its bankruptcy (a maximum of three years &apos; compensation of waste and conditions, as well as another club). 
7. Compensation for therapeutic expenses and surgical operations (including sick leave compensation with a story) 
- 8. Pension compensation (in which capital is provided for you to retire, for example, 25 million, and then you continue to receive your pension to death, which is equal to 80% of your salary every month, and if you die, and if you have parents and children who have a right to your salary.
